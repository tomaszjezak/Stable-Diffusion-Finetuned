# Fine-Tuning Stable Diffusion with DreamBooth

## Team
- Tomasz, Rory, Brodie, Hank

## Overview
We fine-tuned Stable Diffusion with DreamBooth to generate images with specific styles or objects, such as movie scenes or known faces. Our approach requires minimal data, learning specificity rapidly.

## Approach
- **Stable Diffusion**: Enhances image quality and speeds up inference by running diffusion in latent space.
- **DreamBooth**: Introduces a constant subject token, enabling specific object generation across various contexts.

## Key Features
- **Efficiency**: Achieves specificity with little data.
- **Flexibility**: Balances object consistency and context adaptability.
- **Innovation**: Combines diffusion models and fine-tuning techniques for improved specificity.

## Results
- We achieved promising results in generating contextually appropriate images with custom subjects.
- Our approach allows for significant creativity and flexibility in image generation.

## Future Directions
- Extend to custom environments and styles, e.g., movie scenes.
- Explore further with Stable Diffusion XL and Textual Inversion.
